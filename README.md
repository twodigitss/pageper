# 📰 <strong>Pageper Startpage</strong>

<strong>Pageper</strong> is a minimalist looking startpage that aims to be as <strong>simple</strong> and customizable <strong>as possible</strong>.<br>
This Project was born as a small side project trying to learn how to use ReactJS ⚛️.

Or you can run the auto-build script that atomate this whole process.<br>

## 🚀 <strong>Get started! </strong>

This Startpage is <strong>managed</strong> through a <strong>`JSON` file</strong> that contains configuration you set on it, like your username and bookmarks. <br>

You have a <strong>example configuration file </strong>📄 located in `src/config/template.json` to start with. <br>
You can copy the file and locate it wherever you feel like/
<br>
<i>(i put the file there to use it as fallback, <strong>so create a copy of that file for your settings, please.</strong>)</i>.

<strong>You can set</strong> your username 👤 in the "username" default value <i>(obviously dont replace the "username" key, do replace the "Default" text)</i>. <br>

<strong>To add bookmarks 📔</strong> (or modify them), you edit values on the json file, is as easy as opening a new set of values <strong>inside</strong> the `bookmark` category. The code should look like this:<br>
```json
    "username": "your_name_here",
    "bookmarks" : {
        "title_of_your_new_category" : {
            "website_name1" : "link_of_the_website",
            "website_name2" : "link_of_the_2nd_website",
            "website_name3" : "link_of_the_3rd_website"
        }
    }
```
Once you have <strong>finished</strong> editing your configuration, go to the extension (or the running page) and <strong>hit the settings icon ⚙️</strong>. You will see a couple of options, click on <strong>"Upload Configuration"</strong>, select your config file and the page will reload automatically once the file has done processing. 

<strong>If nothing shows or default configuration overrides, you probably have a syntax error in your json file</strong>.<br>

Thats pretty much everything for now. Enjoy (:
